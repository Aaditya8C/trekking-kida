                <p id="p1.1" class="font">
                    Known to be the pride of the southwestern region of Pune, Sinhagad Fort is the first entr√©e to the
                    list of forts in Maharashtra.
                    During the ancient battles, the Sinhagad Fort served as one of the supports to Maharashtra, amongst
                    which, the Battle of Sinhagad in 1671 is one of the most significant ones.
                    Elevated at 1312 metres above sea level, the Bhuleshwar range of the Sahyadris houses this
                    historical monument.
                    With breakneck slopes that protect the fort from all the sides, there are two entrances to enter the
                    fort
                    one is located in the north-east region and named as Pune Darwaza and the second one is located in
                    the southeastern part and is known as the Kalyan Darwaza.
                </p>
                <p id="p1.2" class="font"> Visitors can experience the authenticity and regal quotient of the Sinhagad
                    fort that is almost around 1000 years old.
                    This famous fort in Maharashtra houses a Kaundinya Eshwar Temple and the intricate carvings on the
                    walls of the temple make the fine craftsmanship evident.
                    The Sinhagad Fort offers a breathtakingly spectacular view of the Khadakwasla Dam on one side and
                    Torna Fort on the other.
                </p>


                <h3 id="ch2" class="font">Raigad Fort</h3>
                <p id="p2.1" class="font">
                    Raigad is a hill fort situated in Mahad, Raigad district of Maharashtra, India. It is one of the
                    strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau.
                    Many constructions and structures on Raigad were built by Shivaji Maharaj and Chief Engineer was
                    Hirojee Indulkar.
                    When Shivaji made it his capital in 1674 upon being crowned the king of the Maratha kingdom, which
                    later developed into the Maratha Empire, eventually covering much of western and central India.
                </p>
                <p id="p2.2" class="font">
                    The fort rises 820 metres (2,700 ft) above sea level in the Sahyadri mountain range.
                    There are approximately 1,737 steps leading to the fort.
                    The Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway, reaches 400 meters in height and 750 meters in length, and
                    allows visitors to reach the fort from the ground in only four minutes.
                </p>


                <h3 id="ch3" class="font">Rajgad Fort</h3>
                <p id="p3.1" class="font">
                    Located yet again in Pune, the Rajgad Fort was previously known as Murudev.
                    This fort was the capital of the Maratha Empire for 26 years when Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was
                    ruling the empire.
                    What is more interesting about the Rajgad Fort is that the fort was constructed from the treasures
                    of the Torna Fort.
                    Perched at a height of 1,376 metres above the sea level, this is one of the highest forts in
                    Maharashtra, and the ruins of this fort consist of caves, palaces, and water cisterns, to name some.
                    The Rajgad Fort is constructed on a hill named Mumbadevi Dongar, which means the mountain of the
                    Goddess Murumba.
                </p>
                <p id="p3.2" class="font">
                    The fort takes pride in standing at such a scenic location and is said that Chhatrapati Shivaji
                    Maharaj was hosted here for the highest numbers of days.
                    The history attached to this fort is both interesting and disheartening.
                    Interesting because, the birth of Rajaram Chhatrapati, the son of his Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
                    was witnessed here, and disheartening because, the fort is the deathbed of Chhatrapati Shivaji
                    Maharaj‚Äôs queen, Saibai.
                    Amongst all the forts in Maharashtra, the Rajgad Fort is quite a famous monsoon trekking destination
                    and trekkers, as well as other visitors, prefer to spend the night in the fort itself as it is huge
                    and cannot be explored in just a few hours.
                    There is a temple at the top of the fort that is known as the Temple of Padmavati, which serves as
                    the lodging place for the trekkers.
                </p>


                <h3 id="ch4" class="font">Rajmachi Fort</h3>
                <p id="p4.1" class="font">
                    Rajmachi Fort (Killa) is one of the many historical forts in the rugged hills of Sahyadri mountains
                    (Western Ghats).
                    It consists of two twin fortresses Shriwardhan and Manaranjan, with a wide machi (plateau)
                    surrounding the two Balekillas.
                    Udhewadi is a small village of about 60 households (as per 2011 census report) situated on the
                    machi, at the southern foot of Manaranjan Balekilla of Rajmachi Fort.
                    The fort played a strategic role in the First Anglo-Maratha War.
                    Rajmachi Fort has been declared as a protected monument.
                </p>


                <h3 id="ch5" class="font">Harihar Fort</h3>
                <p id="p5.1" class="font">
                    Harihar fort is located in the Nashik district of Maharashtra. It lies at an altitude of 3,676 ft
                    from sea level.
                    The hill on which the fort is built looks like a rectangular shape from the base village. But it is
                    built on the triangular prism of rock from the Yadava dynasty. The edges of the Harihar fort are
                    almost vertical.
                    The attraction of Harihar fort is the iconic steps to the top of the fort. It is almost 80 degrees
                    vertically inclined.
                    There are Lord Hanuman, Shiva and Nandi idols and a small pond at the fort.
                    The view from the fort is beautiful. You can see many forts and peaks such as Bhaskargad or Basgad,
                    Anjaneri fort, Brahmagiri and Utwad fort from the top.
